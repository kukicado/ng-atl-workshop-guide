# Conclusion

You should now be comfortable with authenticating an Angular app and Node.js API with Auth0. We hope that you've learned a lot during this workshop, and are now armed with the knowledge necessary to tackle your next Angular authentication project with confidence!

## Scaling Angular

Building an Angular app that supports lazy loading with feature modules out of the box paves the way for scalability in the future. Adding additional lazy loaded modules should be straightforward when using the architecture we've covered in this workshop. Our route guards and use of shared modules allows global features to be implemented easily in any additional modules.

## Scaling Auth0

Auth0 provides a powerful and robust Identity-as-a-Service \(IDaaS\) platform. If and when you're interested in taking your authentication solution to the next level, you can explore some of these features:

* [**User Management**](https://auth0.com/docs/users)
* [**Multifactor Authentication**](https://auth0.com/docs/multifactor-authentication)
* [**Passwordless**](https://auth0.com/docs/connections/passwordless)
* [**Anomaly detection**](https://auth0.com/docs/anomaly-detection)
* [**Extensions**](https://auth0.com/docs/extensions)
* [**User migration**](https://auth0.com/docs/users/migrations)
* [**Enterprise identity provider integrations**](https://auth0.com/docs/identityproviders#enterprise)
